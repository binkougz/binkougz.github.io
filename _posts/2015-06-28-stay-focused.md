##专注能帮我们实现任何实际可行的目标

> Staying focused can help you accomplish almost anything, from studying for a test to finishing your work an hour early. Staying focused can help improve your professional life, help you listen to people better, and also help you come up with a solution to problems at a quicker speed. If you want to know how to stop checking your Facebook or phone every fifteen minutes and to stay focused on the task ahead of you, just follow these few steps.

```
   def gcd(p, q):
      if q <= 0:
          return p
      r = p / q
      return gcd(q, r)
```
